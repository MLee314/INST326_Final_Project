# INST326_Final_Project
Overview: INST326 Final Project
Group 8: Michael Kim, Matthew Lee, Ethan Salcedo

The tool that we are creating is a program that keeps track of the userâ€™s account information. The purpose of the program would be to allow the user to store their email and password to an account in an organized space, making them easily accessible for use in the future. We are trying to create a personalized program for storing acount information. There are existing account information saving apps but the scope of the project is to provide our own method of managing accounts that are customized towards the user. How we taliored our program towards the user is by including a nickname for every account entry. Users tend to use the same email for numerous accounts so memorizing their account information is difficult. By implementing a nickname feature, users are easily able to retrieve their information.

For out program, we will using databases throguh SQLITE3, which is a topic that was covered during this course. We will be creating a database, in which the user can store a user's account information. The user will be able to retrieve any information that the user have previously stored. Additionally, the user will able to modify and delete certain accounts according to its nickname. When the program runs, a database will be created storing all of the user's information in a organized manner.

The link below will redirect you to our final project's presentation slides. I made the presentation slides on Google Slides using my school email (@terpmail.umd.edu). I set the settings so that anyone at the University of Maryland with the link can view it. If there is trouble with this link, please let us know.
